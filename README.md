Arty's 1 year of TradingAnalysis code not including the 2 years of code that he wrote
<br>Note!! This is since 2018

This is also a include a TradingBot and a machine learning algorithm

I coded a Trading analysis to take into account the price of over 1,000 stocks. This report was partially designed as a test for a larger price manipulation report I have in the works. While the test was conducted it wasn't necessarily a test of the system. There was more to it, for example, even though the so-called "random order" was there the System processed orders in sequence

# Version : A007:
A trading analysis that compares the profits of different models is a valuable tool for traders and investors who want to evaluate the performance of their trading strategies. This type of analysis compares the profits generated by different models, based on historical market data, and provides a way to assess the performance of each model over a specified time period.

To perform this type of analysis, traders typically start by selecting a set of models that they want to compare. These models could be based on different approaches to trading analysis, such as technical analysis, fundamental analysis, quantitative analysis, or machine learning algorithms. The next step is to obtain historical market data and use it to generate trading signals for each model. This data could include historical prices, volume, and other financial metrics.

Once the trading signals have been generated, the profits generated by each model can be calculated by taking into account the cost of trades, such as commissions and slippage, and by tracking the performance of each model over the specified time period. The results of the analysis can then be presented in a variety of ways, such as through charts, tables, or heat maps, which show the performance of each model in terms of profit, return on investment (ROI), and other metrics.

This type of analysis can help traders and investors to identify the most profitable models and to make informed decisions about which models to use in their trading activities. It can also provide insights into market trends and conditions, and help traders to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different trading models. However, it's important to remember that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results, and that this type of analysis should be used in conjunction with other tools and techniques to inform and support trading decisions.

Trading analysis is a broad field that encompasses a wide range of methods, techniques, and tools for evaluating and interpreting financial market data. As such, there are many different versions and approaches to trading analysis, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, and areas of specialization. Some of the most common versions of trading analysis include:

Technical Analysis: This approach to trading analysis is based on the idea that market trends and patterns can be identified by analyzing price and volume data, and that these trends can be used to make informed trading decisions. Technical analysis uses charts and technical indicators, such as moving averages and oscillators, to identify trends and potential trading opportunities.

# The wide range of methods

Fundamental Analysis: This approach to trading analysis focuses on evaluating the underlying financial and economic conditions of a company or market to make investment decisions. Fundamental analysts study financial statements, economic data, and other relevant information to assess the health and future potential of a company or market.
<br><br>
Quantitative Analysis: This approach to trading analysis uses mathematical models and algorithms to analyze market data and make investment decisions. Quantitative analysts use statistical techniques, such as regression analysis and machine learning algorithms, to identify patterns and trends in market data and make predictions about future market conditions.
<br><br>
Algorithmic Trading: This approach to trading analysis uses algorithms to automatically execute trades based on pre-defined rules and strategies. Algorithmic traders use computer programs to analyze market data and make trades based on specific market conditions, such as price movements and volatility.
<br><br>
Sentiment Analysis: This approach to trading analysis uses natural language processing techniques to analyze news articles, social media posts, and other text-based data sources to assess market sentiment and make investment decisions. Sentiment analysis can help traders to identify market trends and opportunities based on the collective opinions and sentiments of market participants.
<br><br><br>
These are just a few examples of the many different versions and approaches to trading analysis. The choice of approach will depend on a variety of factors, including the individual trader's goals and preferences, the type of market being traded, and the specific investment strategies being used. Regardless of the approach, the goal of trading analysis is always to identify trends and opportunities in the market, assess risk, and make informed decisions about buying and selling assets.
