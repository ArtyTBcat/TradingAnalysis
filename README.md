Arty's 1 year of TradingAnalysis code not including the 2 years of code that he wrote

This is also a include a TradingBot and a machine learning algorithm

I coded a Trading analysis to take into account the price of over 1,000 stocks. This report was partially designed as a test for a larger price manipulation report I have in the works. While the test was conducted it wasn't necessarily a test of the system. There was more to it, for example, even though the so-called "random order" was there the System processed orders in sequence

# how it works

A007:<br><br>
A trading analysis that compares the profits of different models is a valuable tool for traders and investors who want to evaluate the performance of their trading strategies. This type of analysis compares the profits generated by different models, based on historical market data, and provides a way to assess the performance of each model over a specified time period.

To perform this type of analysis, traders typically start by selecting a set of models that they want to compare. These models could be based on different approaches to trading analysis, such as technical analysis, fundamental analysis, quantitative analysis, or machine learning algorithms. The next step is to obtain historical market data and use it to generate trading signals for each model. This data could include historical prices, volume, and other financial metrics.

Once the trading signals have been generated, the profits generated by each model can be calculated by taking into account the cost of trades, such as commissions and slippage, and by tracking the performance of each model over the specified time period. The results of the analysis can then be presented in a variety of ways, such as through charts, tables, or heat maps, which show the performance of each model in terms of profit, return on investment (ROI), and other metrics.

This type of analysis can help traders and investors to identify the most profitable models and to make informed decisions about which models to use in their trading activities. It can also provide insights into market trends and conditions, and help traders to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different trading models. However, it's important to remember that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results, and that this type of analysis should be used in conjunction with other tools and techniques to inform and support trading decisions.
