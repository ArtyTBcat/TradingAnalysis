# TradingAnalysis
Arty's 1 year of coding not include the 2 years of code that he wrote


I coded a Trading analysis to take into account the price of over 1,000 stocks. This report was partially designed as a test for a larger price manipulation report I have in the works. While the test was conducted it wasn't necessarily a test of the system. There was more to it, for example, even though the so-called "random order" was there the System processed orders in sequence
